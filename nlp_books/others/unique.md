Write a detailed coursework template—suitable for a university assignment—that guides a student step by step through building and evaluating a K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classification model on the Iris dataset. Your template should be formatted as a report (or Jupyter Notebook) with clearly labelled sections. For each section, include:  
  1. A brief description of its purpose  
  2. Placeholder headings or sub-headings  
  3. Sample Python code blocks (with comments)  
  4. Instructions where to insert screenshots of outputs (e.g. confusion matrices, accuracy scores, plots)  

The core exercise is:  
• Load the Iris dataset from the UCI repository  
• Preprocess and standardize the features  
• Train KNN classifiers for k = 1, 3, 5, 7 and 11  
• Compute and display confusion matrices and accuracy scores for each k  
• Tabulate and compare the results, and identify the best k  

Your template should include at least these sections:  
  • Title page (title, author, date, module/course)  
  • Abstract or executive summary  
  • Introduction and objectives  
  • Data loading and exploration  
  • Data preprocessing (encoding + scaling)  
  • Model training and evaluation for each k  
  • Results summary and comparison table  
  • Discussion and conclusion  
  • References  

Use academic tone, indicate where figures/screenshots go (e.g. “Figure 1: Confusion matrix for k=3”), and suggest a referencing style.
