Analyze the evolution of language in a corpus of novels spanning different time periods, focusing on the correlation between cultural shifts and changes in the semantics and usage of keywords.

Data:

    Corpus: Novels specified by BOOK_PATHS dictionary (titles and file paths provided; .txt or .pdf format).
    Keywords: 20 keywords categorized by thematic vocabulary (identity, morality/sin, technology/nature, disappearance/absence) and lexical fields (religious/moral, futuristic/colonial, psychological/fragmented, modern identity/race).

Analysis Requirements:

    Linguistic Feature Extraction:
        For each novel: Extract word tokens, named entities (NER), part-of-speech (POS) tags (general and detailed), tense, and n-grams (bigrams/trigrams). Calculate frequencies. Preprocess with lemmatization and stemming. Output a table per book including lemma, tense, POS tag, and morphemes.
    Sentiment Analysis:
        Perform sentiment analysis on potentially charged/evolving words using VADER and Naive Bayes.
    Time-Based Analysis:
        Create tables tracking linguistic feature evolution across novels (Year, Tense, Keyword Frequency). Use label encoding/dummy variables for year.
    Data Visualization:
        For each of the 20 keywords, generate a combined line and bar graph illustrating usage trends across novels. The line graph will show the keyword's frequency across the years the books were written. The bar graph will show semantic usage of the word from different perspectives (e.g., for "woman": race, identity, etc.). Annotate graphs with key semantic/syntactic meanings.
        Provide a function enabling users to input a word and generate its combined usage graph and semantic/syntactic overview.
    Lexical Context Analysis:
        Identify "major words" (TF-IDF) within each novel and analyze their lexical context.
    Inverse Term Frequency (ITF):
        Calculate downward/upward ITF to identify words characteristic of specific time periods/novels.
    Hypothesis Support:
        Support the hypothesis that cultural shifts influence language by referencing "Natural Language Processing in Action, 2nd Edition" and "Natural Language Processing With Python (2009)" where relevant.

Code Requirements:

    Modular (functions preferred over large classes).
    Resource-efficient (memory/CPU).
    Simple and understandable.
    Libraries: NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, PyPDF. Avoid transformers, neural networks, PyTorch. Simple visualization libraries.
    Function to read text from .txt and .pdf files.
    Function to generate a report based on program output.
    Prioritize functions for efficient CPU execution.

Desired Output:

    Identification of trends in word meaning/usage reflecting cultural shifts.
    User-defined word analysis function with usage graphs and semantic/syntactic summaries. Focus on thematic vocabulary, lexical fields, and related word embedding trends (e.g., "woman" and "freedom").

Focus on efficient code: minimize lines of code while maintaining high-quality output. The core functionality revolves around the user-defined word analysis feature. The generated combined graph should concisely show word frequency across books (years) and semantic usage in different contexts.
